## Description
In this gruesome game of trivial pursuit, you are the captive of a demented tortured soul who wants nothing more than to devour you whole, BUT he's willing to let you free if you're able to answer him these questions 3!
***
## Getting Started:

* First I'll be using wireframe to whiteboard the layout and style of the game.
* Then list how I'll want the game to operate.
* Next, pseudocode the structure of JS and each of the games basic functions.
* Then use trello to plan out a schedule of when to have each step worked on and implemented
